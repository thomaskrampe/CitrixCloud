# Citrix Cloud
This is my personal repository for Citrix Cloud stuff like ARM Templates or PowerShell scripts. I collect some of my knowledge, scripts and best practice tool sets which I get during my daily work with Azure as well as Citrix Cloud here. Make sure you visit the [Wiki Pages](https://github.com/thomaskrampe/XenAppEssentials/wiki) for more informations. 

Currently this repository is dedicated to XenApp Essentials only but I will extend it to all other Citrix Cloud Services in near future. On a fist view this is what we build here.

Feel free to use the provided ARM templates and scripts in your own projects and PoC's but keep in mind that all the content is more or less a guideline and **not** a ready solution. Make sure you read the comments and documentation before you use it in your own environment. Every folder in this repository has it's own README so I hope it contains all the informations you need to deploy it in your own projects. All the content is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 license, to learn more about that just read the LICENSE file.

If you think something is missing, send me an email or just contribute your own code here. If you find an issue, just let me know. Any feedback is much appreciated.

Cheers,
